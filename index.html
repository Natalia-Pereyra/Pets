                    <p>How do cats manage to <strong>always</strong> look so sexy is beyond me. Cats move most of the
                        time with something that might seem like inner balance, calm, and confidence. Their eyes and
                        their look are just so sensual and profound, anyone else agree?</p>

                    <p>My cats love to sleep on the couch on rainy days and be all day outside when the weather is nice.
                        Their agility, flexibility and resilience is worth <strong>admiring</strong>. Like all cats
                        they're wonderful hunters, always bringing presents for me..usually moths and insects!</p>

                <p>Meows are not innate cat language â€”they developed them to communicate with humans! We associate it
                    with the cry of an infant, and that's why meowing gives results.</p>

                <p>If you thought cats spent a lot of their lives sleeping, youâ€™d be right. According to Veterinary Hub,
                    Cats actually
                    spend 70% of their lives sleeping, which works out to around 13-16 hours a day. Itâ€™s a catâ€™s life!

                <p>Have you ever noticed that cats walk like camels and giraffes? Their walking sequence is both right
                    feet first, followed
                    by both left feet, so they move half of their body forward at once.
                    Camels and giraffes are the only other animals to walk this way.</p>
